Complete your Prework (if you haven’t done so):

Prework is due 4 business days before the programme. You should have received an email from portal@prosci.com providing access to your prework through the Prosci Portal. Contact us if you have not received this email.

Please be aware that you may not become certified if any training is missed.

Your Instructor will factor in breaks in around the flow of training each day.

IT requirements

Laptop or desktop computer with Microsoft Office 2007 or newer. Mac users, please use Microsoft Office for Mac to ensure tool compatibility.


We look forward to seeing you soon for three days of intensive, hands-on learning. This is a great opportunity to immerse yourself in applying change management to your project or change initiative. It will also be a unique opportunity for group discussion with colleagues in your field.

If you have any questions about preparing for your programme, please do not hesitate to contact us at training.europe@prosci.com.
