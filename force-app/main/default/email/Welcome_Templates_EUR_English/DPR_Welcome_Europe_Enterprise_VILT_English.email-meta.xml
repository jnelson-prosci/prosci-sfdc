    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

We look forward to your participation in {!Training_Event}

Programme Dates: {!Training_Event__c.Start_Date__c} - {!Training_Event__c.End_Date__c} at {!Training_Event__c.Location__c}

The goals for this one-day program are to equip project leaders with an understanding of the importance of change management in meeting project objectives and the ability to speak a common language around change.


PREPARING FOR YOUR programme Prework Requirements

To maximize your in-programme learning experience, you will need to complete a number of prework tasks. You should allow 1.5 hours to complete.

Set-up your Prosci Portal Access and Prework tasks

You will receive an email shortly from portal@prosci.com  with a link to your programme prework in the Prosci Portal as well as access to additional content, resources and tools to support your in-programme learning. 

Once in the Prosci portal, click the “Prework” tile. You should see a drop-down menu that says “Prework Tasks”. Prework is due 4 business days before your programme to allow your instructor time to review.

Pre-Learning

Watch the Integrating Change Management and Project Management (2 minutes) video by Tim Creasey to understand how you can drive greater value by integrating the technical side and people side of change.
Enjoy this brief Tim Talks: The Prosci ADKAR Model (4 minutes) video to learn about the five building blocks of successful individual change and how the ADKAR Model supports organizational change.
Optional - Dig deeper into the why and how of integrating these complementary disciplines in this Project Management and Change Management - An Integrated Approach (1 hour) webinar.
